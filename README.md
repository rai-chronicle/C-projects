🚀 C Programming Project Ideas – From Beginner to Advanced

This repository contains a curated collection of C programming projects, implemented to help learners progress from basic concepts to advanced system-level programming.

Each project is designed to be simple, well-structured, and educational, focusing on real-world problem solving using the C language.

📌 Purpose of This Repository

✅ Practice C programming from scratch

✅ Understand core concepts (loops, arrays, pointers, structures)

✅ Learn file handling and data persistence

✅ Implement data structures & algorithms

✅ Build a strong C programming portfolio

This repo is ideal for:

Students 👨‍🎓
